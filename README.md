# MSc-Project

This is the Python code for my MSc project - the HNP Portal. 
Illustrations can be seen on my website: https://resume-production-c90e.up.railway.app/pg3

It is a dashboard that enables users - students, researchers etc. - to better search within a large dataset related to the history of the Holocaust. It was developed as a prototype for the MEMORISE organization (https://memorise.sdu.dk/), functioning as a concept for what they will eventually create with much more capable hands (and a different dataset).

It combines interactive data visualization with managing a significant dataset (significant data from ~30.000 people) using a SQL database.

This is mainly just to showcase the code. I am still a learning, don't judge me too hard!
